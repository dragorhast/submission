# Group Project Stage 2 – ‘halfway’

Deadline 28/01/18 Weight 25%

## Overview

The tasks for this stage are to:

1. Develop a significant portion of the application(s) using your planned iterations.
2. Submit a progress report detailing the design and implementation achieved so far.
3. Develop a company website.
4. Demonstrate the application.
**Groups should be working on most of these tasks simultaneously, building on work from Stage 1.**

## Assessment

This stage will be marked by both the manager and the Group Project Coordinator. A group mark will be assigned which will contribute 25% to the overall group mark at the end of the project.

## Tasks and Associated Documentation

### 1. Company Website [10 marks]

A small website promoting your group’s software company should be created. This could be a static
website: assessment is on design not the technology used. IS students have studied creative design
in 2nd year and are expected to be involved in the design and development of this site. CS students
should be concentrating on the main application, although the team as a whole should approve the
design decisions.

### 2. Develop a significant proportion of the application

Develop a significant proportion of the application using your planned iterations. **About half the
functionality would be ideal.** Marks will be assigned under the demonstration and progress report.

### 3. Progress Report [10 marks]

Prepare and submit a short report on the group’s progress so far, giving details of what functionality
has been achieved. This report should include:

- [ ] A comparison of the achievements to date and the original planned iterations, plus, if
necessary, brief details of your adapted plan for the remaining weeks.
- [ ] The design of the system so far, including if appropriate: product scope, high level overview
of technologies and components, interfaces, dataflow and/or class diagrams, any other
useful diagrams, and descriptions of any input/output documents and files.
- [ ] Details to date of how the system has been tested for technical correctness and assessed
against expectations.

### 4. Demonstration [10 marks]

Each group should organise a half-hour session with your manager. The whole group should attend. You can have the demo in a lab if you like, or book a small room if you have your own laptops.

Assessment of the demo is based on the quality and quantity of the software. You will also get
formative feedback on the quality of your presentation skills in the demo.

The demonstration should include:

1. A very brief introduction – who you are – and your software group’s website. Each person should summarise what they have contributed up to this stage, in a sentence or two.
2. High-level system architecture, so that we can see what the system components are and what software you are using.
3. Software demo focusing on key features of the application: don’t labour over things like logging in. Make sure you include a good set of testing scenarios to demonstrate functionality.
4. Mention any developments that have been done which can’t be demonstrated but will speed up the remaining implementation (there might not be anything in this category).

It would help if you had a printed overview (maximum 1 page) to distribute to your manager,
showing your functional requirements and what has been achieved. This document should not be
too detailed but should be easy to glance at rather than solid reading.

The demonstration should not take more than 20 minutes. Each person should take part. Members
of the group should run through the program using a prepared plan of events, aimed to demonstrate
the key features. There could be a little audience participation, where the manager asks for certain
features to be demonstrated. The manager will not try the software directly.

It’s important to have a plan for the demo. Prepare the examples. Ensure that you focus on the
most interesting parts. Maybe you could have multiple PCs set up and logged into before the start of
the demo, then changes made by one user can be shown as seen by another user. Rehearse your
demo, and time yourself.

At the end, there may be questions. Be prepared to show the source code and explain how various
functionalities are implemented.

Marking scheme (out of 10):
10 – substantial, robust and usable application, achieved at least half the planned functionality
6 – a little under half the planned functionality, not always robust, a few usability flaws
2 – minimal application with many bugs and poor usability
