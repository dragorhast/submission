# Group Project Stage 1 – ‘the bid’

Deadline 12/11/18

## Overview

The group’s first task is to simulate making a bid for the project. The group bid consists of the
production of the Requirements Specification, Project Plan and Risk Analysis, Project Costing. You
must also create mock-ups of your user interface and do a short usability evaluation.

The expected content of the documents is given overleaf. There is a Software Engineering lecture on
each of the topics where more information is available. Groups should also be guided by the
expectations of their manager and the project requirements. Examples of good documentation from
previous years are available on Vision. Feel free to produce draft versions well in advance of the
deadline to give to your manager for review.

## Documentation Style

Decide on a suitable style for all the documents that you will submit throughout the project. Always
use the same title page to include the document subject, your group number, manager name and
student names. Include a table of contents whenever appropriate.

## Submission

See website for submission details.

## Assessment

This stage will be marked and feedback will be provided by the Software Engineering lecturer and
the manager. A group mark will be assigned which will contribute 30% to the overall group mark at
the end of the project.

As a rough marking guide, for marks out of 5 (half marks possible):
5 – excellent, extremely comprehensive, excellent presentation, very clear
4 – very good, comprehensive, well laid out, structured, with one or two minor problems
3 – good, as 4 but with many small or one large problem. In between 4 and 2.
2 – minimal but adequate, e.g. rather general, poor structure, not much detail.
1 – poor – incomplete
0 – not done

## Documents (also refer to relevant lectures)

### 1. Requirements Specification [10 marks]
An introduction to the project, including purpose and scope, aims and objectives.
A complete comprehensive prioritised description of the software requirements, both functional
requirements and non-functional constraints, organised logically grouped and numbered. Relevant
UML diagrams could be included.

### 2. Risk Analysis [5 marks]
Identify the risks that your group is likely to encounter during the year, and give details of a suitable
strategy to manage these risks. Groups should focus on the risks that they as students might
realistically encounter, not those that their pretend company might encounter. Risks should be
considered in conjunction with project decisions and plan (see below).

### 3. Project Decisions and Plan [5 marks]
By this stage the group must have decided on key issues such as which software to use; which
software process to use; how the complete product will be divided into sub-systems (top level
design); how the software will be assessed for usability, technical correctness and customer
expectations; what each student expects to contribute to the project; and how the group intend to
collaborate. Provide details of these key issues.

Explain when the various tasks will be done; how long they will take, and who will do them. **The plan
should cover both the development and evaluation of the product and the production of all
documents.** Don’t forget to allow for other coursework, examinations and holidays!

All groups are asked to plan their product development using iterations, so at this stage you should
decide on the number of iterations, their duration, and which top level tasks will be in each iteration.
Show dependencies between tasks. For the first iteration, which you will start on immediately after
this deadline, break the tasks down into detail. Later iterations do not have to be planned in much
detail. The plan should be presented clearly, possibly using tables, lists or graphics such as a Gantt
chart.

### 4. Project Costing [5 marks]
An overall budget for the project plus a breakdown of the costs of each section. Consider
development and evaluation. Any additional costs to the customer for hardware, proprietary
software, etc. should also be specified.
For each section, explain how the costs were arrived at. For example, for hardware or software
hosting, give details of current prices from potential suppliers that you have discovered. For staff,
explain how you have divided the group into roles, how much time each person will spend in that
role, and what salary and overheads you have taken into account.
Most of the staff costing should be based on the time that you actually have available and the roles
that you take, but you can invent a few other future details such as training and maintenance.

### 5. Usability evaluation of mock-ups [10 marks]
Once the requirements are finalized, groups should design a mockup of the interface for the
majority of the system. This can be as simple as hand drawn screens or you can use a wire-framing
site such as https://heriot-watt.mybalsamiq.com or PowerPoint with links.

Once you have completed the mock-ups, test how usable the design is. Create an experimental
protocol where by you show subjects screen shots and ask them what they think certain
components are for and get feedback on overall usability.

For this stage collect just subjective data.

- [ ] Subjective qualitative data : ask them open-ended questions on how they found the
experience, what they liked/disliked. If you showed them two different designs, you can ask
them which one they liked best. See the iSneeze Testing Protocol on the group project
website for an example on how to do this. Be careful not to use leading questions (e.g. “I
think this is a great feature, what do you think?”).
- [ ] Subjective quantitative: ask some questions on Likert or Rating scales, a good example is
provided on the group project website, or you can create your own similar version
specifically for your interface.

You are not expected to calculate inferential statistics in this study, you will not have enough
participants.

#### Usability: Resources
You will find the following on the group project webpages:
 Forms – consent form
 Template for usability testing test plan
 Example of testing protocol - iSneeze
 Example of questionnaire

An example of a good report from last year is on Vision under ‘F29SO: Group Project Examples’.
Also see Interaction Design notes from 2nd year.

#### Organising your usability study
Here is a checklist:

1. **Consent form** : use the template provided, make sure you clearly state what is involved in
    participating in this study.
2. **Ethics form** : this form has been done for you. Note: do NOT have vulnerable people as
    subjects (this includes children under 18) or to actively deceive your subjects.
3. **Usability Testing Test Plan** : create a test plan, see template.
4. **Testing protocol:** create a detailed testing protocol, including screenshots if you ask them to
    go to particular screens. Make sure everyone evaluating the interface follows this protocol
    so that results are consistent.
5. **Questionnaires (initial and exit):** develop an initial questionnaire, querying the participants’
    demographics (age, occupation, experience with computers); to gather an overview of the
    participant’s experience give them an exit questionnaire – base this on a standardized one,
    such as SUS, that uses Likert or rating scales. Make sure you gather some qualitative
    feedback.
6. **Pilot:** a couple of the members of the team should run through the evaluation as a subject to
    discover any obvious problems with it. Correct the protocol if necessary.
7. **Recruiting subjects:** try to get around 6- 8 subjects. Try to get subjects from outside who
    aren’t at the university, from a variety of backgrounds and ages, but relevant to the project
    topic.
8. **Perform Experiment:** get each subject to sign a consent form. Save these forms. Go through
    the testing protocol making detailed notes. If you have an exit questionnaire, ask the subject
    to fill it in.
9. **Anonymising data:** all data must be anonymised, i.e. use subject numbers on any
    documents such as questionnaire answers. Have a master sheet with names/subject
    numbers kept safely by one group member.

#### Writing the report
Remind yourselves of what you learned in Experimental Design to make sure you get the
terminology right.

Write a brief report containing:

- [ ] Introduction including aims and objectives
- [ ] Design decisions for your mockups/final product. Include some screenshots to illustrate
your point, add more in the appendix if necessary.
- [ ] Description of your experimental method, referring to your plan and protocol, i.e. what are
you testing?
- [ ] Details of subjects as well as their responses (e.g. number of subjects), age, amount of
computer use). Use descriptive statistics e.g. percentage of males/females.
- [ ] Results analysis, which includes summarizing qualitative feedback and lots of pretty graphs
and descriptive statistics for the Likert/Rating scale questions. If there are particularly low
responses for any questions then this will highlight areas of improvement.
- [ ] Conclusions including recommended changes
- [ ] Appendix (don’t dump anything here without referring to it in your text!):
  - [ ] Usability Testing Test Plan
  - [ ] Mockup testing protocol
  - [ ] Sample blank questionnaire if used
  - [ ] Sample blank consent form
  - [ ] More screenshots if required. Not needed for every screen, but for every style of screen.

This initial evaluation could be repeated more than once if necessary in the development process for
any complex sections. Include any intermediate recommendations in this or the final report.
