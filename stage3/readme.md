# Group Project Stage 3 – ‘Final Product’

#### Weight 45%

In the final stage, the group is expected to complete the product and produce a final report
documenting and evaluating the project. The application should be demonstrated at the Expo near
the end of the process. Additionally, groups containing an IS student should produce a short
marketing analysis and strategy for the product.

## Deadline and Submission

See the Group Project page on Vision for details about deadlines and how to submit.

## Assessment

This stage will be marked by both the Manager and the Project Coordinator. A group mark will be
assigned, which will contribute 45% to the overall group mark at the end of the project. The
student’s final overall individual mark is allocated at the end of the project and consists of the group
mark adjusted by values provided by peer assessment and moderated by the Project Coordinator.

## Tasks and Documentation

### 1. Marketing Analysis and Strategy (Only Edinburgh groups containing IS students) 20 marks

Produce a short marketing strategy for your application. The details of this strategy are up to your
group and should be highlighted during the Expo. You should think about the market for your
product, and support your strategy with any relevant data you can find (e.g., analysis of market size,
product advantage over competitors, product placement, etc.).

### 2. Develop the remainder of the application 100 marks

Develop the remainder of the application. You should have produced an application worth one
course worth of effort, which is user-friendly and reasonably robust. It would be better to have a few
features left unimplemented rather than have produced a full set of features which all contain
significant flaws. Marks for this section will be determined both from the documentation and the
demonstration (see below).

### 3. Final Usability Evaluation 20 marks

Perform a final usability evaluation of your product, similar to the one you conducted in Stage 1 but
using the full system. Again try to get 6-8 participants for this study and think of tasks that make use
of the full set of features you have implemented. Try to collect both _subjective_ data (e.g., what the
user thinks/says) and o _bjective_ measures (e.g., number of successful tasks, time to completion). This
evaluation is separate from the Expo, where you will be showing off the product, not collecting data.


### 4. Final Application Design and Implementation 4 0 marks

Update your Stage 2 progress report for the final version of your system. It should contain:
- Overview of the system, including a high level overview of technologies and components.
- Detailed design of the final system. Include, if relevant, supporting dataflow diagrams, UML
diagrams, class diagrams, etc.
- Final Interface design describing the layout and navigation of the application(s).
- Describe your implementation methodology. Did you use iterations, SCRUM or other agile
techniques? Provide details of what was achieved in each iteration/sprint.
- Summarise how you tested the final system for technical correctness.
- Documentation on how to install/setup/maintain the final system and a short user guide.

### 5. Project Evaluation 4 0 marks

Assess the project as a whole, including recommendations for the future. Include the following 3
subheadings and address (at least) the topics below:

**Organisation**
- How was your group organised? Was it successful?
- How well did your group collaborate? How did you handle any problems which arose?
- How successful were the timings in your original plan?

**Implementation**
- What was your implementation schedule and how did this differ from the original plan?
- Was your implementation approach successful (e.g., SCRUM, other agile, etc.)? Why or why
not? Use specific examples from your experiences to support your discussion.
- Which languages, tools, and techniques did you use? How suitable were they?

**Product**
This section should give a report on the functionality you have achieved. Provide an outline summary
and then go into details. For example:
- How many of your requirements did you meet? E.g., you could also provide a table showing
to what extent each of your numbered functional requirements have been completed.
- What is particularly special about your product? Have you included extra features?
- How robust is your final system? Are there known bugs or constraints?
- How usable did your subjects find the final system? Include a brief summary of your results.

**Appendix of Supporting Documentation**
You may also include any other supporting documentation you think is relevant. This could include
project diaries/report, original implementation plan, marketing material, etc.


## 6. Product Demonstration at Expo 2 0 marks

You will demonstrate your product as part of an Expo near the end of the process. This is a chance to
show off your product to your fellow students, managers, and industry sponsors. You will be asked
to give a 2 minute ‘lightning talk’ and then be ready to demonstrate your product to visitors who
come to your stand. Assessment of the demo is based on the quality of the demonstration and your
software. You will be assessed by your Manager and an additional Manager or the Project
Coordinator.

The lightning talk should capture key aspects of the product in a short amount of time, including:
- The company information
- The product
- And be no more than 2-3 slides (you only have 2 minutes!)
- Practise, practise, practise - you WILL be cut off after 2 minutes

The demonstration should be approximately 10 minutes long and will be similar to the demo you
gave to your Manager during Stage 2. It should include:

1. Very brief introduction: who you are and what you did on the project.
2. High-level system architecture, so that we can see what the system components are and the
    software you are using.
3. Demo focussing on key features of the application. Don’t labour over things like logging in
    and lots of data entry.
4. Any additional marketing materials (e.g., flyers) that you want to hand out.

Each person should take part in the demonstration. Members of the group should run through the
program using a prepared plan of events, aimed to demonstrate the key features. There could be a
little audience participation, where the markers ask for certain features to be demonstrated. The
markers may try the software directly. You may also want to design a printed overview to hand-out
and/or a poster, showing your requirements and what has been achieved, and system architecture.

It’s important to have a plan for the demo. Prepare the examples. Ensure that you focus on the most
interesting parts. Rehearse your demo, and time yourself. At the end, there may be questions. Be
prepared to show the source code and explain how various functionalities are implemented.

Finally, be professional!
